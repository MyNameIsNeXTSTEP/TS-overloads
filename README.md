# TS-overloads
A prototype of a library for methods and constructors overloading in Typescript

### Objectives
Trying to form an OOP tool for typescript programming which allows writing code cleaner, shorter, polymorphically.

The preffered way to implement overloads is using decorators, in which programmer can pass a class with methods | class and methods separately (?) for the decorator later to combine it with processed names of methods, type checks, parameter checks and so on.
